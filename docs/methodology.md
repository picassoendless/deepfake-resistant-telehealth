# Methodology (summary)

This document summarizes the multi-modal verification approach: fusion of voice spectrogram embeddings,
facial micro-motion encoding, and contextual metadata. The scaffold includes placeholder encoders
and a lightweight fusion module suitable for local testing. Replace placeholders with trained models
and add data pipelines for realistic evaluations.
